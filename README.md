##  Project Overview

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. This project applies supervised machine learning on clinical and demographic patient data to predict stroke risk. Special focus is placed on handling **class imbalance** (only ~5% positive cases) using **Random Undersampling**, and evaluating models with a comprehensive set of metrics.

##  Algorithms Compared

| Model | Accuracy | Recall | F1 Score | ROC AUC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | **0.811** | **0.920** | **0.830** | 0.847 |
| SVM | 0.807 | 0.884 | 0.821 | **0.851** |
| Random Forest | 0.777 | 0.908 | 0.804 | 0.826 |
| XGBoost | 0.773 | 0.892 | 0.798 | 0.821 |

> Evaluated using **10-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation** with optimal threshold tuning per fold.

##  Key Findings

- **Logistic Regression** offers the best combination of recall (0.920), F1 (0.830), and interpretability — ideal for medical applications where minimizing false negatives is critical.
- **SVM** achieves the highest ROC AUC (0.851) and lowest RMSE, making it best for probability estimation.
- Undersampling successfully addressed the severe class imbalance and produced balanced, reliable evaluation results.

##  Future Improvements

- Feature engineering to create more informative variables
- Test LightGBM and CatBoost classifiers
- Hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization
- External dataset validation for generalizability
- Model explainability with SHAP or LIME
